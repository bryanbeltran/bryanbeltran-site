# bryanbeltran.us

This is my personal website — built with [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org) using the App Router, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Markdown-based content. It’s where I publish my blog, showcase projects, and centralize what I’m working on.

I built it from scratch using `create-next-app` and intentionally kept it lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.
